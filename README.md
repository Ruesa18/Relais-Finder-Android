# Relais Finder Android App
The Relais Finder is all about CB radio hobbyists finding the best repeater stations for their communication.
To achieve that goal, this app shows Switzerlands repeater stations on a map with all the needed information at the fingertips of the user.

## Requirement
This app uses a simple [backend](https://github.com/Ruesa18/Relais-Finder-Backend) I wrote. It is not yet production-ready!

## Installation
In order to use this app in a development environment you will need to add some keys to your `local.properties` file:
- save your Google Maps API Key as `MAPS_API_KEY`
- save the URL of your Relais Finder API as `RELAIS_FINDER_API_URL`
