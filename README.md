# Relais Finder Android App
The Relais Finder is all about CB radio hobbyists finding the best repeater station for their communication.
To achieve that goal this app shows the repeater stations on a map with all the needed information at the fingertips of the user.

## Requirement
This app uses a simple [backend](https://github.com/Ruesa18/Relais-Finder-Backend) I wrote. It is not yet production-ready!
